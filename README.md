# markdown-builder

> Opinionated Rust crate for building markdown documents.

This project is based of the [markdown-composer](https://github.com/mainrs/markdown-composer-rs) crate by [mainrs](https://github.com/mainrs).

## Why?

This project was forked due to a multitude of reasons:

- Unmaintained
- Not wanting the additional settings to make it work for everyone
- Fun
- Word wrapping
